* Dotfiles
  Lovingly crafted, artisinal configuration files for the finest software
  available.

** Installation
   To install, clone the repo and run =./install=. This should install
   dotbot and get everything linked.

** Emacs
   Everyone's favorite text editor. I've moved my Emacs configuration
   to a separate [[https://github.com/ametzger/emacs.d][emacs.d repository]], although this repo has some
   configurations I've used with Emacs Prelude and Spacemacs in the
   [[https://github.com/ametzger/dotfiles/tree/master/emacs][emacs subdirectory]].
