* Dotfiles
  Lovingly crafted, artisinal configuration files for the finest software
  available.

** Installation
   To install, clone the repo and run =./install=. This should install
   dotbot and get everything linked.

   If on a mac, run =bin/brew= followed by =just brew-packages= to
   install packages.

** Emacs
   Everyone's favorite text editor. I've moved my Emacs configuration
   to a separate [[https://github.com/ametzger/emacs.d][emacs.d repository]]. This repository still contains
   some configuration related to Emacs Prelude, Spacemacs, and Doom
   Emacs.
